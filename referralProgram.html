guys in referal chain cant refer anyone else in chain obviosly

its a staking mining thing not a mlm SCAM . because we create the coins and there is a finite amount. 
but u will get a smol percentage whenever your referees earn thru "mining only"
thru the fact they are staked and u can get a smoller portion of the ones they refer which still makes a difference.
but you get more for the poople u directly refereed ofc. and that ofc changes with mining difficulty but its a nice royalty system. 
2 encourage new users and stuff. 

baked into the staking and mining aspects of the code early on 2 be a unique way 2 keep this chain being useful and widely adopted upping its value 4 all holders 

to encourage early growth ofc more users means less reward due 2 halvening but thats fine. and fair.
