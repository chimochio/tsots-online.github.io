guys in referal chain cant refer anyone else in chain obviosly

its a staking mining thing not a mlm SCAM . because we create the coins and there is a finite amount. 
but u will get a smol percentage whenever your referees earn thru "mining only"
thru the fact they are staked and u can get a smoller portion of the ones they refer which still makes a difference.
but you get more for the poople u directly refereed ofc. and that ofc changes with mining difficulty but its a nice royalty system. 
2 encourage new users and stuff.
