// tsots brain game controller === this is the ai brain 2 control the smaller peice subsets. 


// tho the story gives context for the game mechanic. 
// here the story is the sportsman like challenge of besting the opponent(s) using the revolutionary game mechanic. 

//stretching setting up processes building up 2 Tsots code flow.

// peaces= actors, can take on roles and become different ppl  .
//synapse #1 .. this is the first brain hub synapse used 2 process information


// can be played simply or players can program advanced on baord circutry, u could even program a prcoessor on the game board
// and the ai bots make this game have extremly intresting potential for practical hacker wit against wit. 
// programing electirical traps, or powering the other team and charging them alot. 
// ** the lyfebooks have 2 be powered to be used. if peice doens't have lyfe book, so power and electricity become
// very important if u have a longer game, u dont wanna be in the dark . 

// circuts can blow if u try  2 push 2 much power thur them  2 w/o buying grounders.(1-10)weakest 2 strongest. 
// incentive, 2 make more money, 2 beable 2 harness more power. can build and  buy a huge power storage 2 .
//lights can give visibility at night where their is range limit usually, a lighted tile , will be visible. 
// preventing late night sneak attacks :) 
// water/ plumbing is the same, if a player wastes near water it autocleans. and 2 make plumbing is like  passable water tile. 
// cheap to move water, can be thru building material , 
// building materials, can have electricty or plumbing stacked under them (not both electricty and plumbing tho LOL) 

// refidgeration, just liek storage, but food must be stored in ridge or it goes bad after 4 turns. 
// fridge is just a warehouse that needs power 2 it 2 work, if it loses power , its just a ware house. so
// all u have 2 do 2 make a fridge is connect power 2 it . 

// our implimentation , of technologically advance empire , vs raw power or legal, w/e  VERY FUCKING /
// civ, but next leve, more practical, and online modes with territories, is incredibly expressive. 


// classical game mode ? if yes

// load predefined classic variables and values as follows. 

{
    
    choose classic teams      // select human or ai like the monopoly menu butobviously cleaner, just lil chek boxes. 
    lucky -- on||off human||ai
    sol -- on||off human||ai
    halos-- on||off human||ai                    //    tearits and royalty balanced

/// if online   1-8 players in a room. 
/// online  , games begin and end hourly   , or all day games

// all day games run constantly 

/// where a lobby and board will restart like a movie theater, and ppl can come and go but the game time is running regardless.
// at the end of game time , everything not in warehouses is destroyed. 
// so that if u sit at a table, u collect shit and wharehouse it, whtever it is whether ur farming or wutnot
// and can bring that stuff 2 next table ,a nd perhaps sell it or w/e ur hustle is .
// there fore, at the end of hours or days, after the big operations have made their money and packed up ,
// newbs and looters and try 2 run thur and strip and mad grab any thing of value left behind. 



/// turns cycle about as normal like any board game or card game. in the order in which the players enter the gameboard. 
//they are just pushed to the array . and deleted if they leave , or are killed, or disconnect(they just dissapear, fleeing the //battle feild , way better than cutting their peices their just turning tale they leave anything built , on the board//)
//like leaving money thats in the pot but taking ur bank. 
//
/// if its someones turn, let their peices do their moves , then end turn !

// since players create property that if damaged results in crime, we know whos stuff is on the board,
// therefore, peices owned by a spirit will only act at the end of "THE GLOBAL HOUR TURN"
// once all players have taken a turn in round robben play, or skipped their turn, the game hour changes
// and ALL INDEPENDANT PEICE ACTION HAPPENS NOW ex(growing electricity, ai , clowns, etc. )
