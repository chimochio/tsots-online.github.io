// sketch book of the dead....


//tearit card computer  for game, but game is played only exclusively on the" lyfebook console" k


//*taer it cards conform 2 users personality type
//*when drawn , giving prototypal cards,
//*specail powers from peice method. 

// so basically , there are elements, psychic, nothing, spirit, fire , water, wind, electricity

// and tear it cards then comform from prototype 2 whatever user is using them
// therfore personality become more part of a game because it afects what territs u can access

// for example, smokey peice, can go down 3 "personality evolution paths" 
// psychic
// siko path. 
// then ofc , half and half. 
// depending on how u treat and other peices interact withit, does the peice heal alot ? is it compassionate?
// or does it kill alot and fuck people over diplomatically? actioins really just swing the pendulum back and forth.
// so if u wanna swing ur personality pendulum basically from tru false or and, then u excersize diff strategys, or
// personality conforms 2 peice strategy, independant of user manipulation making it very cool PLUS
// pyschic attacks can change opponents personality or move variable and cause confusion, etc so 
// strategy arises from that


// price of lyfebook in game and irl is 166.66  mark of the beast . as a joke ;)
// so each player must have one 2 do alot of things in game , adn they can be destoryed, or swapped etc. 



// this is the user interface computer for managing peices, saving peices. 
// saving maps, saving tearit drawings, etc .  save large swaths of data . and manipulates that data for the user. 



///tear soul  tear sheets from the lyfe book computer, that u drew on there, 
// artist's " are the mage class in this game, they train with Soul Pens, " that can draw soul spells. for good or evel. 

// art is how things are created and soul . and these ancient mages have connection 2 that. they have initiated smokey and death
// they are mysterious elflike humanoids from the halo realm, and bring the creation
// lucky and soul weild the swords of the spirit, and have halos, but everyone else that wants that kidna power, draws on a lyfebook. 

// this is also were peices manage their info. on their lyfebooks, and their lyfebook has their info. 

// this corresponds 2 every peice. this links and tells the data of every peice. 

// visa vie. this is where we will keep the prototype of every peice , in the lyfe book. 




// tstos  , spirit book paint app. 
//
//Kool little painting software minigame with some cooler funtions than paint ,
// encourages creativity , and lets u paint on photos u took . 

//(creates a custom battle item card(collectible,tradeable)has exp var assigned, can use as spirit for distraction.)
// and scores what u draw based on algorithms, 
//and rewrds u in  game.

//its a program in ur *halo computer, that Sol gives u , basically lets u modify ur army and shit. 
// only lets u draw futuristic stuff. can use drawings 2 take moves from/ sedate clowns. expends them in game. 
//so u could use alot of them 2 beat the last level eazy. 
// 
//https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/logic-if-statements/p/challenge-your-first-painting-app

// has its own page, cuz its running a complex ai drawer in the back ground
// that makes u try 2 follow it to increase ur score, its invisible, but
// the player will notice the score rises if they follow the ai. like draw hero. //

//  Tip size
// Tip color
// Erase button = B
// Hold down A 2 draw
// menu to change color or turn on spirit book

Layered interfaces

When designing an interface for a complex piece of functionality—sending email, for example—you often run into a dilemma. On the one hand, you do not want to overload the user of your interface with details. They shouldn’t have to study your interface for 20 minutes before they can send an email. On the other hand, you do not want to hide all the details either—when people need to do complicated things with your module, they should be able to.

Often the solution is to provide two interfaces: a detailed low-level one for complex situations and a simple high-level one for routine use. The second can usually be built easily using the tools provided by the first. In the email module, the high-level interface could just be a function that takes a message, a sender address, and a receiver address and then sends the email. The low-level interface would allow full control over email headers, attachments, HTML mail, and so on.
