// like the gta lobbies. 

//  can also be an abstraction hang out base for text interactions



// will pull in as default the first army in ur array pop, the one used last.
// the one that is equiped 2 ur profile spirit.currenty


 *_----- super lobbies
 
 
// one player isn't mandatory online
 // u can play baord game with local friends or with computer .
 //Local Classic board game 
---  ONLINE-
    /// ---------classic mode lobby -------
    /// 5 minute game
    //10  minute game
    //20 minute ame
    // 40 minute game
    // hour long game
  
    
    /// board game chess like ez fast lobby  right up at the corner availiable by click at any time, timed games
    // chess ELO rating algorithm .all that jazz, classic boards, 1vs 1  or 2 vs 2 or 4 vs 4 with 2 boards hooked 2gether
    // and the other 2 start on the other side and can team up or be free for all diplomatically strategically..
    
    
// lyfebook spirit profile
    // instead of counting down in this game, it is turn based based on a things being done in a certain time turn frame
    // where during one turn everyone does there things in the lobby in a round robin
    // then when everyone has gone (and u have 30 secs 2 move before that hour is up for u and everyone does that
    // that counts as the global hour, and the next hour starts, 
    // which is important for variable change and food growth and night and day, stock price change,property land,  etc. )
    // even has a dedicated link 2 ebay like market place, with main and individualized sections
    // same with the reddit subreddit, but 4channy like forums, that are all user created, cept a few
    // tsots specific functions and globas. 
    // that masquerate as , forums u buy 2 start a discussion. like ur renting a pervasive logged chat room with chimo money. 
    // for whatever reason u might want 2 , and can shut it down and save it iff u want. 
    // perhaps 2 resolve a dispute between spirits in a text based spirit court that may arize
    // i just want 2 creat a frame work for this interaction 2 happen
    // like creating a play ground, u dont tell ppl how 2 play, u just create possibilities, and light structure. 
    
    // this is beautiful , becuase there is no need for the usual complex, mmo of guessing where ppl will move etc. 
// no lag , and ppl are used 2 playing board games like this, its a board game still way more fun, 
    // cuz the computer does stuff for u , and places restrictions wich makes game exiting. 
    // and gives everyone a  chance to express themself an be heard. 
    //and if someone is taking their turns and wasting them, obviously u can whip their ass.
    // 
    /// i like the idea of having a shark tank like thing at tsots 2 where tsots invests
// tsots money in player ventures. 
    
    // god that will be soooo FUN :) please code this game already
    // maybe u should start with events. 
    // cuz u can make it multiplayer with events if its turn based man. 
    
    // basically , the lobby is  the interface
    // between lyfebook profiles and apps, and the tsots actual peice game 
    // in lyfebook halo , u are spirit. but peices have lyfebooklyte. 
    // which is more like a peice menu to control ur peices methods and shit .
    
    
    // you can mark other people to , if they fucked you over or something, and talk shit about their spirit
    // all over the profile. that is lyke reddit kharma, ppl can rate u on what a good or evil person u are. 
    // and that will ahve 2 do with who will do deals and give u credit and make contracts with u . 
    
    // --- this is what leads into online game, you pop out as a ghost spirit 
    // == thru the ss halo computer and into the console room into ur body . 
    // u can also use this room 2 go back2  the spirit profiles, 
    
    // you cannot get into expanse mmo unless u have a spirit profile and u build a custom avatar
    // for ur spirit  2 inhabit. and u do missiong for lucky and sol and celstial , kinda modeled after
    /// gta 1 player 2 player , difference being, the peices u capture in 1 player are useable by deed in 
    // online mode , like pokemon . and 1 player mode gets progressively harder
    // so u can keep playing ++ iterated games 2 capture strongpeices
    
    // ( peices pulled from here for use in online mode cant be brought back 2 1 player. 
    
    
    // 1 player is basically a little home away from home , where u can get real privacy if u want
    // i am gonna build it last tho if at all, cuz multiplayer is just much more fun
    // or ill build it first 2 get a grasp on coding the game . w/e' i do like the story 2 be told .
    // perhaps 1 player and online can be more integrated, with the missions being the story
    // and u progress thusly  , waiting 2 the sequel for the new missions u hear about lucksy story vicariously/ )
    
    // and it follows u thru the game depending on ur level, time story line continuity between ppl not important
    // and the misison stories are so that they are replayeable, 
    
    // there are inner lobbies within the online mode 2 lead 2 interactive gta type missions or activities
    
// since they are not accesible thru the peices game, since the peices can only use their lyfebooks,
    // and vice versa, the peices cannot be tasked via spirit realm, only traded deeds and stocks
    // stuff like that . more player database management, and sale and market interaction
    // can only sell on a super macro level here, certificates only , stocks, souls , commodities
    // on a number and symbolic basis, using contract method from game, but real live chat talk, 
    // unlike game that has restrictive twitter peice talk. 
    
    // 

//
// and the lobbys are really accesible
