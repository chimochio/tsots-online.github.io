the more you are carrying the less mobile you are. 


items :    // certain items being in inventory  will give auto skills, gun shoot, fishing pole in

// when used, items become dirty and fragile, at the end of turns, dirty items deal vars to peace holding them 



// item calculations = 

// all items are generic "tsots" brand less otherwise specified
// all generic items have item variables, economy variables as well, 2 keep track of how many items are globally in play for all spirits
// with tsots profiles, and regulates economy accordingly . 
// those values route  2 TsotsMarketManager.js , but are born here when the items are initialized into the game thru sale. 
// there is also "?" items, for player created items that get economy variables assigned to them
// availiable for whole sale and for retail prices thru tsots supply stores and wharehouses. .
