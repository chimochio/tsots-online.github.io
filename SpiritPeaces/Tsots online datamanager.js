// One major problem
//in the generation and distribution of electricity is that it
//is very costly to store electricity. However, the demand and
//the supply for electricity can vary significantly, even over
//short periods of time. On the demand side, a sudden increase
//in the outside temperature may induce many people to
//start their air conditioners. On the supply side, clouds blocking
//the sun might significantly reduce the amount of solar
//power generated. The major advantage of smart grids is the
//combination of traditional electricity networks with digital
//technology that enables the remote control of consumersâ€™
//appliances in their houses.
