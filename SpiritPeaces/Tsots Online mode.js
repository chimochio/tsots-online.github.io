// if a peice is left idle, it is not save unless in peace expanse, peices can sit there and forfiet there turns 
// if they dont move in the alloted time, the game play is not quite real time,

// TSOTS IS FIRST AN FORMOST THE PREMIER ONLINE EXPERIENCE
// THE GREATEST MULTIPLAYER GAME IMAGINABLE  \ \ playin this game makes u a rockstar 

// and it is great, because it exploits simplicity of graphics, being closer 2 mud than gta online
// but also exploiting advanced knowlodge of online interactivity to make a smooth enjoyable addictive open creative play space .
// that is only availiable , on the lyfebook console, thru our own provided ISP server network. (like psn)  but that is free. 
// but we only host sites on the lyfebook network (which anyone can make a small site get around the bs , 2 make a
// site comparable 2 anyone online ) ( i ofc will establish, auction networks, the same way the game auction network is set up ) 
// and an amazon comporable wharehouseing infrastructure world wide, to put us as a walmart as well as apple, bellsouth as well.

// has the amazing 4 player mode. which is how tsots board classic is meant 2 be played in spirit
// team. one person does the one move and the teamate provides experties
// u can do this online , teaming with ppl u like in a dojo. and training with them. 
// u can make friends have have diff armys  with diff partners
// and even share territories. this team work can actually make building territories super intimate  .
// very well could work with others 2 mine territories and create online guilds or gangs. going around pillaging. 
// and bringing back spoils

// game hours move differently because their are more than 2 players.
// each player has a time bar 2 make their move before they are skipped . then the turn end. then the hour passes
// and auto functions happen while everyone just sits and watches, and when all auto functions are done
// next hour commences.    (no autoloop will ever happen, only 1 loop of anything  can happen per turn since programming doesn't //actuactully use js BUT SCRIPTURE, in game is a dumbed down very simple version of js.  ) .

// basically walks the player thru an entire Harvard CS courses, i woulda loved if someone tricked me into knowing

/// CONTRACTING COMPANY WORK 
// this is exactly how game dev d runs companies we can make way for this variable prototype engine so mmo players can
// build contracts. 
The game starts off with you developing a company of cleaning  employees. From there, you can select contracts to complete for external clients (e.g. develop a ring tone, game engine, etc.) or create a video game. Contracts vary by difficulty and pay and must be completed within a time frame. If successful, your reputation increases slightly and you get paid. Video games have much higher rates of return but require more time (typically 3 months) and some initial capital investment. As your fame and fortune grows, you can expand to larger offices where you can hire more employees to increase the quality of your games. Throughout the game, more platforms will be released and discontinued, based on real life consoles (such as the Sammy PayStation). Towards the end of the game, the player is also given the opportunity to develop their own console. This can be very expensive and time consuming, and the success of the console rests on how famous the player's company is.

===== THE PERSIAN GULF        NAVAL AIR   EXPANSE============================
    
     http://gizmodo.com/the-us-navys-first-laser-cannon-is-now-deployed-in-the-1659644456
[14:43:00] <+GODSKING> After seven years and $40 million of development, the US Navy has finally sent its prototype laser weapon, one capable of blowing holes clean through UAVs, on patrol throughout the disputed Persian Gulf.
[14:44:29] <+GODSKING> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf
[14:44:42] <+GODSKING> The gulf has many fishing grounds, extensive coral reefs, and abundant pearl oysters, but its ecology has been damaged by industrialization and oil spills.
The Persian Gulf and its coastal areas are the world's largest single source of crude oil, and related industries dominate the region. Safaniya Oil Field, the world's largest offshore oilfield, is located in the Persian Gulf. Large gas finds have also been made, with Qatar and Iran sharing a giant field across the territorial median line (North Field in the Qatari sector; South Pars Field in the Iranian sector). Using this gas, Qatar has built up a substantial liquefied natural gas (LNG) and petrochemical industry.

In 2002, the Persian Gulf nations of Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, produced about 25% of the world's oil, held nearly two-thirds of the world's crude oil reserves, and about 35% of the world natural gas reserves.[8][9] The oil-rich countries (excluding Iraq) that have a coastline on the Persian Gulf are referred to as the Persian Gulf States. Iraq's egress to the gulf is narrow and easily blockaded consisting of the marshy river delta of the Shatt al-Arab, which carries the waters of the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, where the east bank is held by Iran.
