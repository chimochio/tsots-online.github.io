// spirit is the abstraction for ur personal army with which u control ur army from the halo realm
//there fore spirits can still conduct SOME business releveant to their peices
// such as army organization , trades, 
///armys soul  are kept on the soul server , cloud for every spirit  . therefore owner ship can be passed.
//
//

// new users login and answer questions about themself in a fun  survey that everyone takes.
// some tarrot cards are chosen, and that defines some more blanket spirit variables 
// then their spirit type is calculated , and they are given one of 3 types  [ holy , neutral , evil ]
// this will determine in part how loyal ur peices are 2  ur spirit. if ur an evil sprit, its gonna be hard 2 command good peices
// especially if u are against a neutral or good, they will have better time converting ur peice,
// its really hard 2 get super holy tho. cuz ur spirit gets tainted if u are very warlike
//
// even tho ur mission is 2 vanquish evil and establish peace, obviously u can do that with diplomacy hard work and financial //gain. 

// ofc as a nihilis , ur job is to motivate the good 2 make lyfe flourish and punish them with pain if they get lazy
// put the fear of god in their hearts and scare them straight with choas and destruction, a liscence to kill ! >;)
// depending on their type their are told a specific very convincing motivation and recomended a place to start play
// to find likeminded people once they leave the SS solomon. 

// they're spirit arives on the ss solomon and they are made 2 create an avatar 
// they then spend most of their walking time in this avatar, but , sprit obviously can leave a peice just by hitting B. 
//binary= [posses/excercize]

//  the spirits cannot physically do anything , 
// but they have 2 have some way 2 wage war against the nothing, so they inhabited "peaces"
// but i did not come to bring peice but a sword. the sword of the spirit. 
//
//

//

// therefore, every sprit is either aligned with HALOS OR NIHILATORS

// like any mmo  , there are diff perks that blanket all ur peices for either sprit type u choose. 





// you are given help pointers if u want u can turn them off, they kinda explain how to use all the new features. 

// you are told how 2 go back 2 the spirit realm and how 2 come back and forth. 

//armies are kept it cyro sleep in a huge ware house on the SS solomon when not in use. 
// you buy bigger and bigger storage spaces. 
// you can also buy a house in peace mode for ur individual Avatar and choose 2 live like a human, this will make ur
// spirit very neutral , nullifying alot of magic abilities. 
// neutrals will tend 2 be spirits less and atually in teh little peaceful sim city 
// trying 2 use our objects 2 simulate real life processes and even raising a family 


// however, in  1d text picture based, forums facebook spirit mode. 
 // u interact with other player profiles from the heavens. and can trade souls for souls
// and just be a soul trader here .and really engage in the soul market , cuz souls are worth alot more up here
// and not worth a whole lot on earth cept 4 spirit magic. 

// mainly people gift soul points just like a finite amount of facebook likes or reddit karma. 
// and can also give evil points like an infinite amount of dislikes, but also gives u an evil point. 

// and users can make groups and exclude spirit types the dont like, or search for "kindred spirits".
