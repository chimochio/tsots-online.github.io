    Soul : each peace has 1 soul 
 that soul calculates variables and decides how good or evil that peace is .
 if u want to harvest a soul ,  u do this in the spirit world, it will kill the body , and make the soul sellable.
which means some people can have soul farms, 
    
    
    //if an evil spirit were 2 try 2 make a holy soul farm(where u take clones and just make they do good to eachother
    and not ever get crime after alot of turns and all that jazz, so u could kill them all and sell their pure holy souls for alot of money in the spirit market) , it just  wouldn't work very well cuz the peices being disloyal.
    // better u raise good peices and let them die naturally if u want to harvest them for super valuable holy soul. 
    // (after 1000 turns ur allowed to "RIP" a peace, that is harvest its soul without getting evil points on ur spirit. 
    
    // this is the way 2 go becuase this is very valuable, ofc u can keep those good peices alive if u want but its an option in //ur spirits lyfebook when u look thru ur soul inventory)
    // would register the move , but not take action, wasting ur sprits time, and vice versa.
    
    // this sort of soul management can only be done from the spirit real ofc
    // in the peace world, u can only use peice lyfebooks.
