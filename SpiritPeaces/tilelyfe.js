function() tile selected()

pull database for tiles selectable on map.

list of tiles players on map are affectiong
a
b
c
d
etc, goes 2 whichever one was called in a iterating array, pushes 2 list each tile that gets manipulated
and remembers the position of that tile if it needs to(for changing terrain or building)


does tile have hp? 
    how much ? 

building tiles (  players can change the makeup and landscape of the map , new tiles are mapped to numbers of regions on the array, not meant to be legible to humans, this takes advantage of regions in rmmv, 2 create a meta map builder inside the game
               if an array hits the max number of regions we start an arrary of arrays simply  maparrays =  [ array0, array1,etc]
  
                
                Tilelyfe.prototype.maparrays = function(){
    [i++]
}        
                
                

all can be affected by the methods below when called on 
///

// 




// tile background functionality



// cleanliness of tile .  tiles decrease in clealiness, especially if they are lived or fought near
// a cleaning peiece cleans tiles. clean tiles promost better loyalty and motivation
// 

// is tile a rescource ? 
what rescource/
contains {   fuel, water, metals, }
how often does tile produce resource? {25%chance to return plus skill/item added vars };

//is tile realestate activated? 

// alot of tiles are buy sellable , but not all , sols land etc .//
// lawyers can specialize in real estate law , letting them mark tiles as player propert and sell and rent on them etc. 
//also if u own property and someone or something is damaged on it you can get way more in court.

who owns tile ? 
chimochio?
player   by contract/ trespass law 
what is tile value set at ?
