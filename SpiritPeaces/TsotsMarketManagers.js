/// real economies structures calculations of prices and supply and demand and booms and bust of all items
// and a macro header ,and mircovariables within commodities and financial items
// that regulates buy and sell price of items by tsots, regulates wholesale and retail bulk , prices and shit

// based on rarity and availiablity , and amount of money average player and peice and merchant has
// therefore at all times (db calculations per *game hour for all items IN ENTIRE GAME UNIVERSE*) , cept classic games
//((in classic games no items are taken from actuall game , games can only be bet on before hand  by players and observers
// during game count down .((count down isnt vary long)) ((encourages rash sponteneity )).

, prices should be floating variables, 
// they will TYPICALLY find themselves floating near the price they would be found in the classic board game, at least at first
// but with the addition of players, the items should begin to value themself
// ofc in beta testing we will observer what prices the items tend to want to be at. 

///if u map it out like that
[17:18:31] <+GoodwillHunting> u just have 2 add 1 more # 2 ur adverage
[17:18:41] <+GoodwillHunting> every time u add a user 2 the database
[17:18:49] <+GoodwillHunting> for their item data 

//  the Market manager also keeps track of real estate location tile prices for all tiles in game
// as it also keeps a pool database of real time player peice contracts legal stats and yes all stats
// can be used every hour 2 very elegantly keep a running book on the legal and economic world of tsots and that info
// is supplied back 2 the player , perhaps by a scrolling stock ticker , that also feeds relevant game news, and announcements
// for tournaments, etc, and can be turned off obv. 
//
// the ticker is just an updating array
//[17:22:49] <+GoodwillHunting> angular probably has a scroll pre made

[17:23:26] <+rooney> poor old smash
[17:23:35] <+GoodwillHunting>  u know
[17:23:38] <+GoodwillHunting> the top 2 markets
[17:23:43] <+GoodwillHunting> are silicone valley
[17:23:45] <+GoodwillHunting> and wallstreet
[17:23:52] <+GoodwillHunting> i wouldn't say poor old smash

its not like im hooking that up for each player
[17:24:49] <+GoodwillHunting> it creates new db for each player 
[17:24:57] <+GoodwillHunting> and just listens 2 the db each in game "hour"
[17:25:08] <+GoodwillHunting> all hours should probably synch up tho
[17:25:21] <+GoodwillHunting> which players will have 2 wait for games 2 start
[17:25:29] <+GoodwillHunting> or
[17:25:30] <+GoodwillHunting> no
[17:25:35] <+GoodwillHunting> they can still enter whenever 
[17:25:38] <+GoodwillHunting> its like a movie theater
[17:25:41] <+GoodwillHunting> see that works great
[17:25:53] <+GoodwillHunting> it would be way harder if this wasn't a board gaem


yea

mmo expanse entrances  have police , just like peace mode, but it only has them at entrance 2 expance, 
    // so that ppl cant camp and bottle neck new ppl coming in.  so as long as you conduct legal operations 
    // around that area , and its owned by chiochio so it cant be built on 
    // also dont want players building a wall around the radius lolbut, cant really stop them from doing that
    // and cant have the guards attacking them for trying 2 break the wall property crime so...
[17:32:01] <+GoodwillHunting> the guards have crime readers
[17:32:10] <+GoodwillHunting> but they need 2 have a radius they move
[17:32:14] <+GoodwillHunting> and no further
[17:32:36] <+GoodwillHunting> and u know then just stomp someone who does some fuck shit around them
thats better cuz i dont wanna spawn ppl thats gay

/// attacking the same peice that just attacked you , only yeilds between 25%and50% of regular crime point toll. 

ofc
[17:36:21] <+GoodwillHunting> u can climb walls
[17:36:27] <+GoodwillHunting> so
[17:36:29] <+GoodwillHunting> hmm
[17:36:43] <+GoodwillHunting> at least u would beable 2 have filed ur armies out
[17:36:55] <+GoodwillHunting> just come early

guards will guard a space reasonable for these things. 


// crime is like stars on gta, just way more. and depending on skill of lawyer, can prosecute all crimes on a peice. or just 1. 

// you can "escort" enemy peices, where you threaten them and let the  decide to come with you, it doesn't cost ur peice
// a turn , only your opponent has to move your peices


// escort is a diplomatic skill , that can also be used to move multiple peicse. 







/// item manager === think ebay, amazon .


/// most of these items dont have art attached to them , just a name. 
// ofc later we can pin any image 2  them ,
// but they can just exist as functions with variables in a drop down menu for now, unless its something 
// simple , like wires, or we/ we will draw them, most thngs we use already exist in rmmv art.
