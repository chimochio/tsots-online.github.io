/// plugin for real testable game code/

//global functions // generic common events

// we will write all real code here, probably best 2 write them as tiny lil plugins
// that way there most organizable and editable, then u can peice them 2gether later

/// seriously i would start by doing every tiny little thing. just to get some working code out
// and build from there
// even to start on   moves, and    turns , and hunger and go from there, get a peice working and move it.

// also look at libraries

// and moving the stuff that isn't working code but more descriptive, out of the plugins folder .



/// server side game manager for all games




Tsotscode.duringturn = 

//isdead?   =  if any peices health reaches zero at any time it will immediatly show as dead


//retaliate? = check  if a peice is able to retaliate , if so retaliate

//===
// Tsotscode.turntaken = every peice registers when a turn is complete, and begins its bodily functions .also
//  a method for peices .every new peice made receives this method. 
//===
// minus from stomach 
// minus from stress level (all peices shed stress)
// //is sick?  == reduces health ( peice could be sick from dirt or disease or bad/poisoned food/drug);

// is a waste peice? if so do adjacent damages. 
// waste peice radiates morale,loyalty, damage sickness, sadness chances etc. otherwords clean good.
// big waste doesn't dissapear but must be moved  *dump truck*cleaning bots*
// cleaners have immunities 2 waste and ways of dealing with it and even disposing of it thier important, start as maids, but
// can end up being like the wolf in pulp fiction

// is plant? = grow 
// uses electricity? = consume electricity 

// peices radiate a bit uncleanliness to surrounding tiles after every turn 

// especially depending on their  "manner" which is a subset of the calculation of their soul and beauty and lil charism
// there are alot of little easy combo codes formulas liek that happen in the back ground and make this really alive GOD .


// is rescource gatherer? replenish according to formula tiel res + tool quality
