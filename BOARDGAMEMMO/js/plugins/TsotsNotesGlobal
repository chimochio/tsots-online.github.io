// i dont have prisons, but you could definately build and house captured peices in
// since u can capture thru loyalty . 
// (territories are expected to deal with their own criminals, u can only levy fines
// ( no arrest method is good, over complicated. ))

// HACKERS CAN HACK ENEMY VARS OR THEIR OWN , ON LYFBEOOK 2 STEAL MONEY ECT, 
// BUT HACKER CAN TEAM UP WITH LAWYER 2 PROSECUTE THAT 2 HGUE EXTENT EXPERT WITNESS COMBO.
// hackers are really good for , programing a dumbed down version of javascript , called scripture, 
// which u have 2 buy loops u buy iterations, and theirs limits 1 , 3 and 5,and very expensvie a 10. for automating tasks. 
// so that includes looping an electrical current, if the current ever returns to where it originated, that counts as one loop
// and decreses the available loops. a contstruct can only hold a 10 loop at a time, and if you have to many on the board
// the game will throw cap ur power if u try 2 hack into an infinit loop and ur wiring will explode, not a bad way 2 make a bomb
// or even if u put in some shitty java script tryign 2 be a jack ass. and if u throw js error, it could blow ur power as well. 
// so just stick 2 using switches and vars. addition subtraction etc. those cost money for hacker 2 use 2 
// plusand minus  way  cheaper than multiply and divide. and the bigger the variable the more it costs hacker 2 use  as well. 
// this is paying for memory  . in the game. if u try 2 build 2 big a computer, it will probably all shut down black out
// burn out and be unusable. or at least the parts where it fucked up in the flow. the game manager listenenr  will check /





//// --- learning new skills from teachers======= /// 
// machine learning, peice learning simulataed = when a  peice learns a new techinique
// they actually REALLY suck at it, and it often back fires, while that learned stat goes up a exp learning curve. 
// some high level shit , has a steeper learning curve than other stuff. espe computers. law , rockets, etc.  

// awareness , listener, getter, setter  changer of vars. 

// this is a step by step alpha demo script 2 play the classic game.



/// how we make ai challenging without being super scientists ////// 
/// classical mode , gets harder, by making the game peices stronger here (DUMB OVER POWER AI )
// we explain that 2 the player exactly so its not deciept. we give ratings 2 these dumb classic levels.
// the players peices remain constant at all starts.
// this makes up for the fact that the ai cant strategize like human, hower, online, u totally play humans.
// and in future we will build an engine like chess that plays like human. as we expand our //AI.





















*tspts- is the name of this big imaginary company in the game. asianeque global with ties 2 the chinese government and was started by  a bunch of mysterious anonymes john does.. .
// they are responsible for making ur body 
// the crazy thing about 1 player mmo , is that u JUST get ur avatar. 
// its up 2 u 2 buy any clones or capture peices from other ppls army at tables, but yea
// u literally start off with jack shit ., but u can go thru the story missions 2 slowly build up 1 full 22pc armydeck. 
/// in classical mode all the peices are already on the board, but in online mode, any time you enter a board,
// your peices are in a whare house, and can be selected out one by one , or can be in vehicles ofc, since
// ware houses can hold vehicles. thats how everything is transported, because ur main warehouse has 
// the size u pay chimochio for it. \\
// at the start of the game , you dont even have a whare house.

// and you are told u were made in heaven and sent 2 defeat the nihilators ,but since u spawned very weak
// you are only fit 2 clean up after the real tacticians, logigicians and strategists. 

// this bums u out but then this really cool character comes thru and kinda gives u a lead 2 ur first mission
// he works for chimochio , his name is the fox, and hes a slick badass and gives throws u a bone, and u end up 
// washing the deck of battleship , when a man named edge hires u 2 help keep his depressed boss in good spirits. 
// by doing all his laundry and cleaning up bottles so lucky can be presentable  HAVE ENOUGH CHARISMA AND LUCKY for the president and UN 
// the president will trust lucky to do this triple agent mission. IF LUCKY CANT IMPRESS THEM U FAIL AND START OVER. 

// if u succed u go with edge as a "mercenary janitor" and the story unfolds from there, u as this 3rd wheel tagalong narrartor
// sicario type bitch the whole way. but at the end u should have built up a nice bank, and even
// ur own army 2 hire out 2 lucky and help him take mars and save earth!!!1 .
/// a funny thing is ur lyfe started on the SS, so when u come back , the wolf recognizes you and u feel at home. 
// but lucky is a fish out of water.

// the hilarious thing about all these missions, is they have 2 do with u building ur clean up team
// but they often assist lucky in very battle oriented things/
// ofc when u "graduate" u can pursue w/e kinda army u want. 
// but u play thru story mode with a decidedly clean up army, cuz its the least sexy , most necissary job. 
// cuz lucky is especially gross, and he has 2 beable 2 seduce gem and stuff, u have 2 buy him a suit
// 
// spuce him up etc. to where u kinda become the familys clean up angel

// thru ur spirit u get 2 control luckies peices 2 , but . u only get 2 keep the army u build urself cleaning, and u get into //catering , and taking more responsibilites of logistical backend for luckys family and army. 
// mostly alot of clones who drive and deliver food n catering  stuff but now its like karate kid wax on wax off ur ready 4 the //big leauges. 

// the idea also being, in classic mode u dont have a cleaning crew and should begin 2 build one, so 
// playing thru 1 player missions gives u that practice already ,and u have an edge in the tournaments n stuff 
// that are held for grandmaster classical players for big chimochio bucks. $$$!!!!:o:O:D!!!!!

// 
// the story missions kinda guide you as a pawn hirling bitch in luckies army , edge dangermans helper, clean up bitch.
// but ur supposed 2 be inspired by this cleanup rival of urs who is a free lance cleaner named "the fox"

// and hes like a super suave james bond type guy and he has a crew of worker who clean shit, and u cry wanting 
// to be like him , a logistical god. 
// so you start your own company and you get hired 2 go to 

// and there is kinda of there own back story going on , and lucky was supposed 2 be investigating them
// but then all the suddun sol came out of nowhere



// when u first start the game, u start as a soul coming in and out of the universe, it shows like a rebirth
// karma scene, then u appear and have 2 pic an "AVATAR"   of a lyfe u will inhabit. 
// and there just male/female /bigender/(female with penis, male with vagina(lets them do weird sex)) and all tehse diff body types

/// the players dont have a chat room,perse, they can talk peice 2 peice, as a move and can onli say twitter like thing/
// but they can also do this on lyfebook 2 multiple ppl on the mane page of news, that can be read as a turn by a peice. 

// entering the site is a whole diff style of play and communication cuz its really a virtual mmo board game
// like from minute one. 
// it auto loads ur save like ur fb profile, and u just enter the game at ur house, or a hotel.or(ss soul hub). (there are save games here)

// there is no str8 up 1 player its all online, but the story is told thru missions . and u can do them alone
// so thats ur 1 player

// too stay up 2 date, its very cute way of communicating with ppl in game like a virtual facebook, 
// just ur turn is still on a time limit so... u browse on ur lyfebook 2 long and ur turn could end b4 ur done. 
// so u wanna be a fast haker. 
// kinda like our occulus solution, we can look at the lyfebook net , purely made in game in turn
// everything is done in turns even online. even 1 player stuff. its the hole styel of th egame
// even when were in 3d. we will still do turns, just more complex moves during that turn. 
// at the end of the day, is an mmo board game : D
