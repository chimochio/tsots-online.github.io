//========== JS.peices.  ( tactile drag and drop script studio ((((((((can later upgrade 2 use other languages. )))))))) )



//------ douglas said 2 write a programming languages---- this is what were writting.

// ==  an interactive , lightweight minimalist, pocket os. 

// cheap flimsy and editable, customizable, just like our tablets. 



/// open different colored bubbles, the bubbles are primary colors
// and depending on which color u put this stuff in does diff stuff.



// works very much like the reason music studio . 
//

// recognizes voice commands, and allows u to assing voice commands, 2  js commands. 
// or rather. "Machines"
// machines control the flow of information, 
// as do cables,(color coded)
// that hook into "Synthesizers", that let u add nobs and levers , like switches and variables
// and label them
// and make "LIbraries"
// and "Brains"
// brains sit at the top of a machine. and control how the "Machine" operates its "Sythensizers"


// all that comes out into the "Program"
// which is a special console ineterpreter, that outputs ur program in a window (SCREEN)


// Screens are multileveled projects, 
// each brain has its own screen it collapses out into 


// everytime u make a screen project, it goes in ur prototype library. 

// and u can call instances of it on a tree. 

// you go online. and share your trees and art, and trade tare its, and blood, and soul stocks. 

// its just a lil mini communiity , its not supposed 2 take over the world or anything,,
// just a kewl cheap lil niche that tech allows us 2 dominate if we do it the right way
// alot of cheap chinese shit lol.  ALIBABA, ,, put a prototype 2gether please. 
//yes u will have 2 order parts. 

// therefore, also has a music player, and music editor build right in like garage band. 




// the cool thing about the cheapness of a lyfebook, is u can load some stuff on it, then gift it 2 someone. 


// or loan it to someone, and have alot of them that doo diff things like books, 
// can have some that are lil servers, etc. 
// and u can controll them all from one !!!!!!!!!! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<BIG INNOVATION AND SELLING POINT> >>>>>>>>



// its like a music and game designing computer. and animation. play machine. 
// makes simple games, not rpg, but like physics games,
// lets u programs mechanics and music 2 gether
// and even string a program over multiple lyfebooks for ultimate expressiveness. 

// mash up your program with someonelse easily even over the net, its super SAFE ! 
// just make sure u back u programs up in ur huge online storage warehouse.that u subscribe to thru uss.
// THE SOUL SERVER :) 
// you upload ur lyfebooks 2 virtual machines and can have as many virtual lyfebooks u want 
// as long as you are a subscriber, you have acess to your lyfebook data base, and anyone else who u are linked 2 . 


// half a book is 50 dollars, u can also buy 50 dollars have a book of space on the soul server. 

// the programming drag and drop block are like little gummies, some will link 2 others and some wont. 
// its very visual so just try stuff out :) 
// you can also place text files or numbers in them .
// files of js. that can manipulate the bubble .
// or u can drop lil js. peices into the bubbles. ((LIBRARY LANGUAGE))
// or u can do both ! :) open ur gummies up , they can store pictures and code and plain text documents and programs.


// its a programing language that works on everything. because its pure and simple. 
// not commercial or forced.
