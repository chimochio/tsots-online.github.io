////=================================########$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
// SIMPLE IMPLIMINTATION < BUT EFFECTIVELY FUN!!!!!

////============================

// player creates overworld sim city type thing they can spend time building

//lil dungeon builder.  (u can run clones thru them and get soul from killing them

//	which is more valueable than clones so this is a fun game)*****************
 

// then pit their territory up against others, 2 try 2 trade with them , 
// for alot more money, 

//basically an advanced sandbox enviornment where u build while u keep ur army alive and loyal . 
// trying 2 build an empire of clone stocks and big bank and cool castle dungeon w/e custom. booby traps etc. 

// attach 2 other players maps online, with your friends, up 2 8 ppl attached :o  (new type of dnd.)
//::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
// and u can also try 2 invade or tax them, and it can work. 
// u play a timed game in the arena with the territory you made. 
// loads territory. 
// custom type map, digital pet  type map . function. 

// clean pet shit. feed pet, use pet 2 make money , train pet xp, etc. 

// kinda the new digimon army concept. advance wars super plus interactive connectivity :). namaste. 
// *buy barracks, etc. 
// courthouse - actually has use unlike sim

//  neighborhood - can sleep lots of ppl in one



// clone factory. 
// can farm food
// bank does stuff. 
// very fun mode. 
// absolutely necessary god. shoulnd't be 2 hard, will be HELLA FUCKING FUN. just beefed up board, running itself. 
// levels, and height, can be created in the same way we have them. inaccesibility vs acessibility . for strategy. airplanes.

// AI online info storer. level of peices player bank. defense power of territory, rescourse yeild. = terRank



// territory mode AI brain check list. 

// did player peice?    build move eat die? is clone? is clown? is food growing?
// should items be acting? 
// markets runnning in shop, bank, farm, 
// how much money  in 
// day and night. 
// is peice training? 
// is peice in library
// is peice 


// memorize long term data  here. 

// memorize short term data here. 
// refresh custom.peice cache

// memorize player custom peice data vars. 
//  make peice//
// hungry
// waste
// Loyalty drain//
//control clowns
// control zombies ( dead peices turn 2 zombies ez  drain loyalty and do damage only snipers can kill. )


// is it day or night ( peices get tireder faster at night 15% faster)
// peices get little tired all the time, but way more if u use them
// can make them sleep on bed 4 turns 2 restore energyVar
//   
// load army. load peices in army, up 2 22. (ofc u can load up 2 var clones depending map size 20/30/40)

// farm// produces food faster , greater yeild. must be tended. is cheap to start and upkeap. 
// clone can upkeep
//
// training dummies- better attack 

// 
// library. - goes 2 get better diplomacy   generates no profit , generates rand loyalty . 

// this is adopted from civ but put more practically for peice use. 
// gas station. (store)  superstore (sells everything and cheaper more costly 2 build and maintain. SED)

// factory - make mechs cars etc. //very expensive 2 build and maintain.  ceo must remain in shop



// bank. can be greatly taxed. costs alot to build. interest rates  good. can get great loans. 
// basically board game banker on steroids , but he has 2 stay in bank for 
// it 2 do anything. (functioins cease.) money not acessible, disloyalty grows. 




// shop. upgrades merchant supply// costs 2 build and to upkeap maintain. can be taxed
// merchant must be in shop for it to be open.
   // his prices vary 2 allow for deals and stuff. ai. rand. 
food 
weapons
clones 
fuel
pets dogs cats, bats fairys, protection and loytalty


// not much more complex than that , this digimon plus options. essentially plays just like the board game. 
// just more map customizability so its fun , like a dungeon maker, sim. set up ur dungeon, build it while u live in it. 
// so it solves the minecraft problem, u have 2 keep ur army fed and loyal and clean, they aren't under attack, but
// clowns could take over. and even kill you or bankrupt you. and loyalty actually drains quicker in this mode
//. because, since ur building alot ur clones get tired super quickly just like they do if u build in board game, 
// the reward is greater if u pay attention . cuz u have more time 2 build than u would in board game, and more options. 




//Build.                  // this is essential the level customization thing.

// randomly generates, enemy AI territory level. based on 10 diff
// lay out randomizers, and player skill lvl asking for . 

// kinda like mgs online. lvl up ur base against, online bases. 
// u can also go against territories ppl online built and set up
// dungeons, if u cant beat  them they take from u 
// if u can beat them u take from them
// ppl perfect their dungeons, and dont make them live till they think their un beatable
 // and they care about they , because they use their own peices !!! 

// random will generate a setting, with sepecific level hazards
// ex quicksand lava , water, cliffs, etc. 

// random will generate around a block width path so players can move around. 
 // random map gen path shapes [ x, y, S, A, Z, 5, f, #, @, & ]









// road:give greater mobility 2 cars
 wall: protectiion , great variety of "wall" types in custom mode with different costs. plan a building project!
- ex, fence, earth, water, mountains, castle, smartwall, stairs, roof, (durability(able 2 get very high, buy building over
	(just increases tiles durability 2 near invincibility 4 autists who love their shit:keep playing addiction)))


// building heavily drains clone health and loyalty and hunger, they can quickly die or turn 2 clowns when ur building alot. 



//clone factory , 
 is clones on territory < 50
 if true produce.clone. 
 	if no. produce.clone stock.
