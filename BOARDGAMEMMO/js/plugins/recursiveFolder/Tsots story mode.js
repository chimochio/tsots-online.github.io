// meet maid in ur place



// where u first meet gem

//  u learn how 2 use the gym and dojo, and bet on urself against the super big guy 2 impress gem u have 2 beet him,
// and he keeps getting stronger, so u really have 2 somehow make lucky good at combat, which obviously u have 2 make him
// learn warrior methods, even tho he will never use them himself, lol. ofc, unless u want him 2 but, hes better suiter for other stuff.thats why gem sais she be ur body gaurd, cuz u barely make it out the fight alive, then gem comes in to fight u right after
//and u have to survive her thrashing as well, when ur health is already low 2 impress her lol . 

* her"affinity"  towards  your lucky peice will go up alot (when this is high enuff peices can fuck (clowns dgaf, will fuckwhatever so u can also make them prosititues and be a pimp lol ANYWAYSSS ))
////////// D   O   J   O        /// *also availiable instory mode, just not as extensively (basicaly can bet on urself using the odds to grind money if u lost it all in stocks. u dont make that much unless u risk odds against the big guy(keeps getting stronger) .)



//Beat 8
//Black Magic

// learn stuff
// lucky meets, PUNISHED< the name of the nothing they have 
// in the nothing feild vortx
// they have in this big humming lab
// beneath the hadron collider halo super computer. 

// this nothing is actually lucky , if he woulda stayed in afganistan
// sol caputured him also, as he dies and flickers out of existence
// and transforms, or is being eated by or sacrificed to a nothing monster feild Sol captured. 
// using universe scanning multiverse scanning imager detector and soul feilds, 
// using the halo data base, its really incredible technology. 
// its really disturbing to watch , but sol makes lucky watch it
// and tells him its something else, but it gives lucky a new spirit power. THE black nothing ball. 
// very cool powerful soul draning power bomb. charges his soul, can convert 2 soul stock/
// farm more cash lol . ofc it takes alot of soul 2 do , and may fail . recursively
// drawing soul from another nothing multiverse of a slightly diff version of self. 
// that the nothings has 2 erase over anyways, (yes the nothing actually serves a huge purpose)
//() u just dont wanna get served !)u need the tools 2 fight back . always  .  ) ) )
// and then 2 cherry top it, sol is like , yea lucky, and thats what ill do to u if u cant
// complete the mars mission ! . ( like the tree of good and evil ) // 
// the particle accelerator is like a time machine for matter
// which is why it can do time math and really funky ass shit. 
// the tarrorters use it alot along with the soul burner for some secret thing their doing
// in some native taer it tounge. 
// no one knows what they hell their doing, and their language is purposefully 
// indeciferable. 
// the anitmatter collider 2 . 

// if antimatter and matter meet they nihilate. // 
// there is a force that must fight against anti matter //
// at the big bang, thats sol and his machine, and sol power, 
// has 2 use math 2 jack a large quantity of soul energy into the big bang. 

// or fucked up shit will start happening, untill eventually the nature 
// of the real universe will collapse under pressure and zap into a tiny dot. and eplode into nothing. 

// The problem lies in the efficiency and cost of antimatter production and storage. Making 1 gram of //antimatter would require approximately 25 million billion kilowatt-hours of energy and cost over a million //billion dollars.
// so anti matter is mined, on the ss, and sold
// because the big bang isn't set to happen for billions  of years, (hes on a estra time frame, sol)










// Beat 9
// Necromantic























//Beat 10 


// Imagination

// use ur memory 2 think of events that took place in ur life and make spirit skills 
// just talk 2 differnt people and tell eachother your backstorys and u will get *inspiriation exp .
// that ispexp will unlock ur spirit skills.  along with looking thru books, and Sketching 
// in coloring book mini games.
// with an ingame paint tool for a certain amount of time. *counts paint steps. lil coloring book game.
// fill certain areas with shades of colors . encourages artistry and creativity in a way no other game has
// i love this feature. , ur drawing with the sword. 2 try 2 bring shit 2 life. 
// ex. draw a frog ( ) js will check how much green was used ect.. how long the pen was on the page . how much black
// was used etc. kool kode// u keep ur sketch book on u at all times, and can doodle in it 2 increase
// ur inspiration xp now !!, the tsots, its kinda like a pen, in a way. .... like a soul pen ;)
// game rewards u for spending time drawing and doing pen strokes on diff areas of the draw pad. 
// basically just by logging what u do and how many times u erase in the same area etc. 
// u can save and work on like 100 diff peices of art if u want . and trade those online 2 . the most detailed ones
// can be sold. and hung on ur space ship.  and used as a item that yeilds tax money .
// its like a weapon, like ur flag, that depending on how complex it is, wiill have a higher exp variable attached 2 it
// that will make it generate more money per turn, so the best users usually have the most complex flag,
// or just a complex pattern or something cool, for enouraging perosnality and complex criticial creativity easily
// within the community. 
// very rudimentary photoshop element 2 this gameplay making it extrodinarily innovative for a lil board game trading
// peice game, and very fucking awesome and legendary .
