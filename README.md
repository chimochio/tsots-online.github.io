FAUCET ( will pay from its TX fees and stuff that it collects for doing tx's and other stuff. and will pay out bigger based on how much it banks in, 
in lotteries and stuff therefore its opposite of mining off blockchain we dont wanna do that with ppls blockchain , so we do this instead its fine . thats
4 tsotsOSAFE 2 . 
\
we import mv make a fake moonlighter sort of shop game with miners going on harvest moon shit etc trading 
nothing 2 crazy just a landing for most of the gameplay. 
the monster can be put INSIDE the 2d game in a ranche /ranches and cared for in a 2d yet very 1d way. 
um do this 4 cool gui like next level shit not 3d but yea so yea. ... 
\\
everything will pass 2 either main heroku node every 5 hours or w/e is free otherwise p2p will do it asap. 
also thats when cloudkit will pass(or later if no players ) its specific tsotsOS stuff or w/e 
and that will be otherwise seperate. ofc u can send the TX's from cloudkit 2 blockchain all as a lump cuz u know they are legit. 
but they usually validate on heroku just not these. cuz they generated from the system already. we treat it like source code. 
otherwise, we are using a postgresql(sql3deltes ) db on heroku like they teach in that harvard class. (and anyone else can also set their own up 2 cloudmine this stuff0

want to host the node (main node) on heroku (nothing 2 do with cloudkit(but can cloudkit mine 2 or w/e who knows.
but as long as node is runnning in heroku and others run node home or heroku who cares. then we just use that on swift or tokenize it so
we dont even need 2 rely on it 2 do our own pseudochain transactions we will always verify on the blockchain whenever someone cloudkitmines.

the cloudkit mining coinchain that holds this chain and is able 2 transact and exchange with it will have its own value and be able 2 be mined otherwase on mac swift and can even do a cmd line export . or can just mine on phone mac all that stuff and the other coins on mac shoudl exchange into the tson coin ofc were just gonna do the tson coin alone on the JS but branch out all those other weird coins and excchanges in js and on swift. 
and the faucets can also create maybe the coins from swift ? or else just xchange ez w/e but yea will do 2 separate coins that actually join when the
thing has 2 update. they can all trade freely ofc. 

pet : pimp out (hold more pets ) more variables health strenth etc. feed this into the monster fighter 2 let monsters do arena. put bets w/e etc. more training etc monster rancher the variables can identify monster and unique blockchain code
doesn't much more but u can randocm color gen etc type w/e move idgaf from db. also just like monster rancher but w/o graphics 4 now is fine. shouldnt' be that hard tbh. crytpo kitties but more accessible. 


MIX THE VOXEL WITH AR.JS AND ADD THAT OBV... w/e 
]


(thinking of doing elements and player collection here 2 (figthing turnbased on a board with stuff on it >? ) in rmmv ?arena of armys like bots but with collectibles>?
like original ideas for this space. 

(would keep them seperate or not it doesn't matter ? its nice when ican take monster 2 watch or something? 
so mabye its way u can use ur characters in 2d or 3d w/e . 
(so we will have a batch of functions that affects them all easily for js and swift. 


keywords javascript crypto faucet github solutions etc. (ppl can find accidentally here) 
Medium article type things etc





guardemons ( we are gonna treat them like living things that use tear it cards in battle. 
will still do the tear its but. 
battles i want 2 be like chrono trigger where there are consumable elements and levels 2 build 2 4 ur monster, that u stock him up with 
before a battle, (but they are consumed ) but u buy elemenst for cheap at the stoer heals fire ice thunder blackness posion etc, 
and ur demon have particular traits 2 augment or lessen the effects of certain elements  ofc. 

make the mud VERY GRINDY (but make players beable 2 fight eachother with thier characters and have multi characters with diff spells

and those same characters are mini tear its that can level up 2 the 2d TSORD GAME (which can be deleted or modded but still pushes up 2 3d stuff . 

but mud is beatable demo kind of  2d is beatable but longer harder even , and then ofc 3d not even a beatble thing just bigger cooler stuff w/e . 






tsotshtml is mostly played with tactics plugin but minigame functions with rpg menu <3 


also (place from purchas ALL The rmmv blocks availed duh ! . and u know... multiplayer... )) minecraft _+ tactics 2d mychara setup 


we will have many dungeons littered thru the story mode they are procjen with enemies and will be like moonlighter however that works lol cept 
items u get are real and actually tradeable
proc gen expanse levels will just be dumps of dungeons but w/o enemies
