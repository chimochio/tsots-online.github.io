everything will pass 2 either main heroku node every 5 hours or w/e is free otherwise p2p will do it asap. 
also thats when cloudkit will pass(or later if no players ) its specific tsotsOS stuff or w/e 
and that will be otherwise seperate. ofc u can send the TX's from cloudkit 2 blockchain all as a lump cuz u know they are legit. 
but they usually validate on heroku just not these. cuz they generated from the system already. we treat it like source code. 
otherwise, we are using a postgresql(sql3deltes ) db on heroku like they teach in that harvard class. (and anyone else can also set their own up 2 cloudmine this stuff0

want to host the node (main node) on heroku (nothing 2 do with cloudkit(but can cloudkit mine 2 or w/e who knows.
but as long as node is runnning in heroku and others run node home or heroku who cares. then we just use that on swift or tokenize it so
we dont even need 2 rely on it 2 do our own pseudochain transactions we will always verify on the blockchain whenever someone cloudkitmines.

pet : pimp out (hold more pets ) more variables health strenth etc. feed this into the monster fighter 2 let monsters do arena. put bets w/e etc. more training etc monster rancher the variables can identify monster and unique blockchain code
doesn't much more but u can randocm color gen etc type w/e move idgaf from db. also just like monster rancher but w/o graphics 4 now is fine. shouldnt' be that hard tbh. crytpo kitties but more accessible. 


MIX THE VOXEL WITH AR.JS AND ADD THAT OBV... w/e 
]


(thinking of doing elements and player collection here 2 (figthing turnbased on a board with stuff on it >? ) in rmmv ?arena of armys like bots but with collectibles>?
like original ideas for this space. 

(would keep them seperate or not it doesn't matter ? its nice when ican take monster 2 watch or something? 
so mabye its way u can use ur characters in 2d or 3d w/e . 
(so we will have a batch of functions that affects them all easily for js and swift.
