// Dear lucky tripleagent 666,  nihilators, exists because life exists ,
// they are bugs of jank code
//that exists darkly on the server of life, falling from the halo like dust
//and they collected into the huge swarm, over trillions to the power of trillions 
//of infinities.
//we must take up this ancient relic, the sword of the spirit , and defeat them. \\\
